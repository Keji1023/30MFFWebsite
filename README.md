# 30MFFWebsite
Project Name: 
Expo-Rience 30MFF Website
Project Description: 
The Expo2020 30MFF Website is inspired by the experiences of Keji and Salama at expo 2020 Dubai. The video was filmed with mobile phones and the general overall theme is discovery. Our hope is to provide an insight into our expo2020 experience and inspire others to explore. 
Process: 
A lot of time was spent on trial and error with CSS as I tried to overlay a lot of content on top of each other. I also tried to limit a few pages to be exactly one page which led me to learning about object fit, float and other CSS elements. I tried to use Javascript for the photo carousel but I believe there were mistakes in my code as the display and function are wonky.
Reflection/Evaluation: 
I was able to implement most of my wireframe ideas with HTML and CSS. However, a lot of time was devoted to the navigation bar, color selection and the carousel (which didn't pan out well).Overall, it was a good attempt and I am hoping to learn more about Javascript and CSS styles to create better websites
